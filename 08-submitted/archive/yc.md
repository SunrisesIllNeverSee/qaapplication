# Y Combinator Summer 2026 — Answers

Drafted: 2026-05-26 | Status: Draft v1

## Q1. Company / project name

MO§ES™ (Ello Cello LLC)

---

## Q2. What batch do you want to apply for?

Summer 2026

---

## Q3. Are you looking for a cofounder?

No

---

## Q4. Cofounder info

N/A

---

## Q5. Other co-founders / team

Solo. MO§ES™ was designed team-agnostic by intent — the protocol doesn't require a specific implementation team, it requires the right team for each deployment. A protocol that only works with one team isn't infrastructure, it's a service. I look forward to building with many teams.

---

## Q6. Who writes code, or does other technical work on your product? Was any of it done by a non-founder? Please explain.

I write all of it. My build partner is Claude Code — every product surface was architected and shipped in parallel sessions using Claude Opus 4.7 and Claude Sonnet 4.6. That's not a shortcut, it's the proof of concept: the same constitutional governance framework I built (MO§ES™) was the operating substrate for the sessions that produced it. The SIGSYSTEM measurement instrument has now logged 21 of those sessions — 7,327 conversational turns, 35,242 lines of code across five build days, 94.66% cache hit rate, $0.0007 per line of code. No non-founder technical contributions. The architecture is mine; Claude Code is the pair partner.

## Q8. What is your company going to make? Please describe your product and what it does or will do.

MO§ES™ mathematically formalizes and measures "signal" in language, then uses that measurement as a constitutional layer for AI systems and agents.

Signal is the commitment-bearing content in any language interaction — the part that carries meaning, intent, and obligation. We measure it. We extract it. We enforce it.

When an AI pipeline compresses, paraphrases, summarizes, or passes language between agents, something either survives or it doesn't. MO§ES™ is the substrate that proves which — and blocks execution when it doesn't. Not a policy layer bolted on top. Not an audit log after the fact. Constitutional enforcement at the moment the action fires.


The initial problem I set out to solve was building the first operator-based AI leaderboard — video-game-style metrics and stats for AI users, not models. Today's AI measurement is model-only: benchmark scores and like/dislike buttons. Nothing measures what the human operator is actually doing inside their sessions.

That rabbit hole led me to Commitment Theory. To produce stats on users inside private conversations, you first have to identify what's being measured — and in AI, there's only one substrate rich enough to carry that signal: language itself. Commitment Theory quantifies the unquantifiable: it treats commitment as a conserved physical quantity in language, the way energy is conserved in classical mechanics.

Commitment is what emerges when you apply thermodynamics, laws of nature, and physics to language. The Conservation Law: C(T(S)) ≈ C(S) — commitment is conserved under governed transformation. Empirically: 0.94 stability in governed regimes vs. 0.42 ungoverned at 10 recursive iterations.

From there, the bigger problem revealed itself. The same measurement instrument that scores operators also governs systems and agents — because they're language-based too. Quantified commitment lets you enforce behavioral constraints, sequence enforcement, and conflict resolution between agents at the execution layer. Not before policies. Not after audits. At the moment the action fires. If the action doesn't meet the conservation threshold, it doesn't fire.

MO§ES™ is the substrate that does for the preservation of meaning what TCP/IP did for data. It doesn't describe governance — it executes it.

Live surfaces today: SIGSYSTEM v1.1 (measurement instrument, 1.123B tokens across 21 sessions), Signomy (agent marketplace, 270 API endpoints, Stripe Connect, signomy.xyz), KASSA v7 (voice-AI commitment-kernel demo, live in browser, no auth), Signal Army v1.4 (76,313 words across 6 production runs), AQUA (founder-first application OS — this YC application is being built through it).

---

## Q9. What tech stack are you using, or planning to use? Include AI models and AI coding tools you use.

Stack: Next.js 15 / React / TypeScript, Supabase (PostgreSQL + pgvector), Python (SIGSYSTEM ~1,500 lines), Stripe Connect, Zenodo (DOI-hosted paper). VS Code, GitHub.

AI models in active use — operated through a multi-Claude switchboard that routes tasks across models by capability and cost: Claude Opus 4.7, Claude Sonnet 4.6, Claude Haiku 4.5, GPT-4o, DeepSeek, Gemini, Grok (two versions), Devin, GitHub Copilot, OpenAI Codex. Claude Opus 4.7 benchmarks #1 across all five measured kernels per SIGSYSTEM v1.1 against the Artificial Analysis Coding Agent Index over a 7-day window — which is how we chose it as primary.

AI coding tools: Claude Code (primary build partner — 21 sessions, 7,327 conversational turns, 35,242 LOC across 5 build days, 94.66% cache hit rate, $0.0007/LOC), Devin, GitHub Copilot, OpenAI Codex. The switchboard is itself a product surface of MO§ES™ — every model interaction passes through the McHenry-Axiom-gated compression pipeline (patented).

MCP (Model Context Protocol) plugin layer: custom MCP servers wired into Claude Code for Supabase (live DB reads/writes during build), Stripe (payment and subscription tooling), Brave Search, Figma, Notion, Pinecone, MongoDB, n8n, Canva, Gamma, and a custom Application Hub MCP server (21 tools, 7 resources, 3 prompts) that the AQUA platform runs on. The entire development environment is MCP-native — tools talk to live infrastructure directly from inside the AI session.

## Q10. Please provide a link to the product, if any.

mos2es.com / signomy.xyz / mos2es.xyz

---

## Q11. If login credentials are required for the link above, enter them here.

KASSA: no auth required. Signomy: open browse. SIGSYSTEM instrument available on request for technical due diligence.

## Q12. Why did you pick this idea to work on? Do you have domain expertise in this area? How do you know people need what you're making?

Out of necessity, obsession, and because it's a genuinely interesting problem to operate in.

I am not credentialed in AI, NLP, or physics. I'm a Rust Belt operator — University of Buffalo, 20 years of professional experience, first AI session July 2025. I came in without academic priors, which meant I hit the measurement gap immediately: I couldn't tell whether outputs from AI pipelines meant what the inputs intended. Not toxicity, not accuracy — commitment. Whether the obligation the input expressed survived the transformation.

That gap turned into research. By March 2026 I had a published, falsifiable physics paper on commitment conservation in language (Conservation Law of Commitment, DOI 10.5281/zenodo.20029607, five versioned releases, public falsification harness). I did not set out to write a physics paper. The empirical architecture demanded it.

How do I know people need it? Every FDE team I've spoken with has the same problem: their pipelines pass tests, hit SLA, and still get reported as broken by users two weeks later — because commitment kernels drift silently. Volume telemetry tells them nothing about that drift. They write one-off custom validators per deployment and most ship without proof. And the Gartner forecast — more than 40% of agentic AI projects cancelled by end of 2027 specifically because organizations cannot govern them — is not a market opportunity argument. It's a problem statement with a number attached. The measurement instrument that solves it is already built.

## Q13. If you are applying with the same idea as a previous batch, did anything change? If you applied with a different idea, why did you pivot and what did you learn from the last idea?

First YC application.

---

## Q14. How far along are you?

Same way most of the industry measures the wrong substrate — volume instead of commitment — they tend to default to volume-based traction signals: MRR, waitlist, DAU. Pre-seed at the protocol-substrate stage, the signals that matter look different:

5 U.S. patent filings + MO§ES™ trademark — compression substrate, signal compression engine, civic infrastructure, conservation law, master architecture. Filed Sept 2025 – Feb 2026.

Openly falsifiable preprint — Conservation Law of Commitment, five versioned releases on Zenodo (V.05 = DOI 10.5281/zenodo.20029607). Public test harness, refutation conditions explicit. Openly testable for nearly four months; nobody has broken it. The framework now publishes as Commitment Theory because it survived the attempt.

Benchmarks: #1 across all five measured kernels against the Artificial Analysis Coding Agent Index over a 7-day window — 94.66% cache hit, 17.9× output-to-input ratio, 810K tokens per task, 1.84 min per task, $0.0007/LOC.

Four live product surfaces — KASSA voice demo (live, no auth), Signomy (270 API endpoints, Stripe Connect), AQUA application OS, Signal Army.

SigRank beachhead shipping — operator-based AI performance index, video-game-style stats and ranks. Where the substrate becomes a product you can buy.

Volume traction comes after the beachhead lands. Substrate traction came first.

## Q15. How long have each of you been working on this? How much of that has been full-time? Please explain.

July 2025 — first AI session. September 7, 2025 — first patent filed. Full-time since October 2025. ~10 months continuous.

That arc — first session to published physics paper, five patents, four live products, working measurement instrument processing 1.123 billion tokens — compressed into 10 months. The same recursive survivability the framework predicts turned out to apply to the founder.

---

## Q16. Have you formed ANY legal entity yet?

Yes — Ello Cello LLC, registered 2025, sole proprietor, holds all MO§ES™ IP and trademark.

---

## Q17. Are people using your product?

Yes — SIGSYSTEM instrument in active production use (21 sessions, 1.123B tokens). Signomy marketplace live. KASSA voice demo live, publicly accessible, no login required.

---

## Q18. Do you have revenue?

No — pre-revenue at the protocol layer. First paying pilots targeted within 90 days of seed close.

---

## Q19. Worked together before?

Solo founder — N/A.

---

## Q20. How do or will you make money? How much could you make?

Every product in the MO§ES™ ecosystem is designed to be self-sustaining on its own revenue before it funds the next layer. That's not an accident — it's the architecture.

Signomy (live): agent marketplace, 270 API endpoints, Stripe Connect. Earns on every governed transaction that clears the constitutional layer. Revenue compounds as the marketplace grows — every new agent listed increases liquidity for every other agent.

AQUA (live): founder-first application OS that turns recurring essay labor into a compounding answer bank. Freemium SaaS — free tier, Pro ($19/mo), Team ($49/mo). Every application filed through it strengthens the answer index for every future application.

SigRank / Leaderboard (shipping): operator-based AI performance index — video-game-style stats, ranks, and insights for AI users. Consumer product built on the same SIGSYSTEM measurement substrate. Where the framework becomes a product you can buy and brag about.

KASSA (live): voice-AI commitment-kernel demo. Eliminates NLU re-inference per call (50s → 6.5s). Licensable as a voice infrastructure primitive to any platform running voice AI.

Near-term wedge: Commitment Quality Monitor sold to FDE teams at AI labs. ~$1M ARR from 10–15 design partners at $50–100K/year.

Medium-term: Constitutional Gateway sold to enterprise compliance offices. EU AI Act Article 99 penalties begin August 2, 2026. $10–50M ARR.

MO§ES™ is a sovereign entity. Its clones, products, and surfaces are each available for acquisition, white-label deployment, and licensing independently. A buyer can acquire Signomy without acquiring AQUA. A platform can white-label KASSA without taking the full constitutional stack. An enterprise can license the SIGSYSTEM measurement instrument as a standalone SaaS. [EXPAND: insert 7-ring architecture here — the ring model defines which layers are licensable vs. sovereign-only vs. acquisition targets. Add when available.]

Long-term compounding unit: every passing trace becomes a Vault Artifact — cryptographically signed, lineage-bound, tradable as digital property. One OTel span = audit + contract + payment obligation simultaneously. The system pays for itself through what it produces.

---

## Q21. Have you taken any investment yet?

No. Bootstrapped to current state — preprint published (five DOIs), five patents filed, four live products, working measurement instrument, trademark registered.

---

## Q22. Are you currently fundraising?

Yes — targeting $1.5M seed (SAFE). Architecture complete; capital accelerates deployment, not invention. Use of funds: patent prosecution, infrastructure scaling, first enterprise pilots, developer relations, operational runway.

---

## Q23. Other ideas considered?

AQUA (Application · Question · Answer) — founder-first application OS that turns the recurring labor of applying to accelerators, grants, and fellowships into a compounding answer asset. Every question ever asked by any program, stored once. Every answer you write, reusable forever. AI-native drafting, fit scoring, and a rolling answer bank that gets smarter with every application filed. This YC application is literally being built through it. Live.

SigRank — operator-based AI performance index. Video-game-style stats, ranks, and leaderboards for AI users — not models. WN8 for everything. The first public product built directly on the SIGSYSTEM measurement substrate. Where the framework becomes something you can buy, compete on, and brag about.

Post-Turing Test — a new measurement standard for human-AI collaboration depth. Not "did the AI pass?" but "what did the operator produce with it, and can that be scored?" Extension of the SIGSYSTEM instrument into a public benchmark category.

---

## Q24. Who are your competitors? What do you understand about your business that they don't?

Six adjacent categories, none competing at the same layer:

DevOps observability (Datadog, OpenTelemetry, Grafana) — tells you the system is running. Doesn't measure meaning.

ML observability (Arize, WhyLabs, Fiddler) — tells you model output is accurate vs. ground truth. Doesn't measure what survived transformation.

Constitutional AI (Anthropic, RLHF lineage) — model-internal self-feedback for harmlessness. Architecture-locked, non-falsifiable, doesn't operate on the signal itself.

Governance-as-a-Service — enforces policy at agent output level. Operates on outputs, not on an invariant extracted from the signal.

Provenance systems (C2PA, Numbers Protocol, Starling Lab) — verify that content came from a source. Don't verify what survived transformation.

Policy engines / "control planes for AI agents" (Cordum, Aegis AI, Galileo, Microsoft Agent Governance Toolkit) — inline at the action layer, block what fails declared policy. Reactive and descriptive, not constitutive.

What I understand that they don't: our moat lies in four provisional patents, benchmarks that surpass anything currently available, and academic work that is falsifiable. The Conservation Law of Commitment can be tested and attempted to be broken at any time — and for nearly four months no system or person has broken it. That is why it has evolved into Commitment Theory.

The structural reason none of these competitors can become MO§ES™: nobody else built it from physics first. They all built from policy first. You can't retrofit physics onto a policy-layer system. Standard 0.8⁴ fragility math predicts four 80%-viable modules should produce 41% structural coherence — measured result is 80–85%. Governed complexity compounds coherence instead of multiplying risk.

---

## Q25. Where do you live now, and where would the company be based after YC?

Buffalo, NY now. Post-YC: Bay Area / NYC for the batch and growth phase. Company location follows where enterprise pilots land.

---

## Q26. Explain your decision regarding location.

Buffalo is where this was built — not because it was convenient, but because that's where I am. Rust Belt, no local AI investor ecosystem, no YC alumni network nearby. The fact that MO§ES™ exists, came from Buffalo and not Stanford or Palo Alto, and has not collapsed under the recursive stress the framework predicts as a failure mode, is the empirical proof that both the physics and the operator hold.

That said, YC is in Mountain View, enterprise AI buyers are in San Francisco and New York, FDE teams at Anthropic and OpenAI are not remote-only. Relocating for the batch is not a sacrifice — it's the point. Buffalo is where the idea was forged. YC is where it scales.

---

## Q27. How did you hear about Y Combinator?

[CONFIRM — X/Twitter, newsletter, or long prior awareness?]

---

## Q28. What convinced you to apply to Y Combinator? Did someone encourage you to apply? Have you been to any YC events?

YC is the only accelerator whose bar I respect enough to want to clear. I've applied to other programs and pitched at Pitch×Deel NYC — the framework gets recognized as category-creating, and the gating question is always implementation readiness, not concept validity. YC is where implementation readiness gets stress-tested properly.

No specific person encouraged the application. No YC events attended yet. First application.

The Summer 2026 timing matters: EU AI Act enforcement begins August 2, 2026 — Article 99 penalties. Every enterprise AI deployment in regulated industries faces a compliance deadline within weeks of when this batch ends. The timing is not incidental.

---

## Q29. Please record a one minute video introducing the founder(s).

[ASSET NEEDED — record first. 60 seconds. Suggested: open with 1.123B tokens / 0.94 vs 0.42, state the physics claim in one sentence, show KASSA live, close with the Buffalo frame.]

---

## Q30. If you have a demo, attach it below.

[ASSET NEEDED — KASSA v7 screen recording + SIGSYSTEM dashboard, cut to 2:30.]

---

## Q31. Optional: attach a coding agent session you're particularly proud of.

[ASSET NEEDED — run /export in Claude Code. Recommend: SIGSYSTEM v1.1 build session or AQUA/Application Hub session. Stats: 21 sessions total, 7,327 turns, 35,242 LOC, 5 build days, $0.0007/LOC, 94.66% cache hit, #1 across all five measured kernels.]

---

## Q32. If you have already participated or committed to participate in an incubator, "accelerator" or "pre-accelerator" program, please tell us about it.

No prior incubators or accelerators. Pitch×Deel NYC was a pitch event, not an accelerator program.
